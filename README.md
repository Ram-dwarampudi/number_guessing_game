# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game written in C language. It was one of my very first coding projects and holds a special place in my journey as a programmer. 😊

## 📌 How It Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player has to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess was too high or too low.
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
